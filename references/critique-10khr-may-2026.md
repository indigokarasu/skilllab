# 10khr Reference: May 2026 Grinding Session

Concrete actions taken and why.

## ocas-critique → ocas-finch (May 24, 2026)

### Fix D1: includes: missing
- **Pattern:** Skill had `references/` dir with 9 files but no `includes:` in frontmatter
- **Fix:** Added `includes:\n  - references/**` between `license` and `metadata`
- **Reusable for:** ALL skills with a references/ directory. This is the #1 D1 failure across the library.

### Fix D9: Script lacks --help
- **Pattern:** `self_update.sh` had no `--help` flag
- **Fix:** Added `[[ "${1:-}" == "--help" || "${1:-}" == "-h" ]]` block with usage, description, and options
- **Reusable for:** Every script in any skill's `scripts/` directory.

### Fix D3: Duplicate content in Anti-patterns
- **Pattern:** Anti-patterns section had duplicate entries
- **Fix:** Removed the second occurrence of each duplicate
- **Reusable for:** All skills with long Anti-patterns/Gotchas sections.

### Frontmatter patch gotcha with block scalars
- **Pattern:** Description uses `description: >` (folded block scalar). A patch inserted lines inside the block instead of after it.
- **Fix:** Re-wrote the entire frontmatter block.
- **Reusable for:** ALL skills with `description: >`. After patching frontmatter, always verify the YAML.

## ocas-critique self-perfect (May 24, 2026)

- Added `includes: [references/**]` to frontmatter (D1)
- Created `scripts/critique_code_ratio.py` — JSON output, meaningful exit codes, argparse --help (D9)
- Created `scripts/10khr_runner.py` — library assessment + targeting engine (D9)

## 10khr Session May 24, 2026 — Pass 1

### ocas-multipass (36 → 41/50)
- Removed duplicate `## Support file map` section
- Moved inline loop prevention rules (13 lines) to `references/loop-prevention.md`
- Added loop-prevention.md to support file map
- Fixed: D4 3→5, D8 3→5, D3 4→5

### ocas-custodian (37 → 43/50)
- Fixed frontmatter: moved `license:` before `metadata:`
- Cleaned description: removed embedded `## Config Recovery` Markdown heading from YAML block scalar
- Added `## When NOT to Use` section (was missing)
- Reconstructed truncated file
- Fixed: D1 3→5, D10 3→5

### ocas-critique (41 → 44/50)
- Expanded description from 2 lines to full [What][When][Keywords]NOT formula (522 chars)
- Added concrete tool commands to Phase 1
- Fixed: D2 3→5, D5 4→5

### Lessons Learned
- execute_code `split('---')` is unsafe for YAML block scalars with embedded newlines
- Heuristic scorer (10khr_runner.py) over-scores by ~7-10 points vs real rubric assessment
- Frontmatter patch tool edits can corrupt block scalars — always verify YAML after editing

## 10khr Session May 24, 2026 — Pass 2

### ocas-reach (41 → 46/50)
- Converted "Trigger conditions" to standard `## When to Use` and `## When NOT to Use` headings
- Moved inline storage layout to `references/storage-layout.md`
- Moved inline OKR definitions to `references/okrs.md`
- Fixed D3 3→5, D4 4→5, D8 4→5, D10 3→5
- 248 → 234 lines, code ratio 14.1% → 11.5%

### ocas-bower (43 → 47/50)
- Added `## When NOT to Use` heading
- Moved 13 inline decision invariants to `references/decision-invariants.md`
- Fixed D3 3→5, D4 4→5, D8 4→5, D10 3→5
- 280 → 270 lines, code ratio 15.7% → 16.2%

### Lessons Learned (Pass 2)
- Support file map table formatting: patch tool can double `|` prefix on table rows
- Moving inline content to references/ is the single highest-impact fix pattern
- Standard section headings required even if equivalent content exists under non-standard headings

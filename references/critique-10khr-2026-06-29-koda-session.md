## KODA Profile vs Indigo Profile: Key Differences

### 1. Imported community skills dominate the bottom

The lowest-scoring KODA skills are imported community packages (agent-code-goal-planner, agent-coder from ruvnet; software-architecture-v2 from sickn33/diegosouzapw). These have:
- Broken frontmatter (name mismatch between dir and frontmatter `name:`)
- Non-standard fields (`color`, `capabilities`, `hooks`, `type`, `complexity`, `risk` at top level)
- Useless descriptions ("Agent skill for X - invoke with $X")
- No license, no author, no metadata.hermes

**Fix:** These can't be incrementally patched — they need full rewrites that preserve the original knowledge while replacing the metadata layer entirely. Read the full SKILL.md body before rewriting; the knowledge is often good, the packaging is bad.

### 2. Duplicate `gh` + `curl` bloat

Skills like `github-pr-workflow`, `github-issues`, `github-github-repo-management` show the "gh way + curl way" duplication pattern. Every operation has two near-identical code blocks. **Fix:** Keep only the `gh` path inline (since `gh` is always available in KODA); move curl fallbacks to `references/rest-api-fallbacks.md`.

### 3. The cross-profile write guard

When Jared says "KODA's skills," he means the profile at `~/.hermes/profiles/koda/skills/`. The active profile is `indigo`. Writing to KODA's skill directory triggers Hermes's cross-profile soft guard. **Fix:** use `cross_profile=True` on `write_file`/`patch` calls. The skilllab skill already documents scanning across profiles for reads, but should explicitly warn about the write guard for KODA-targeted operations.

### 4. Scoring distribution

KODA starts with a different quality profile than indigo:
- Indigo (per June 29): 61/61 at 50/50, average ~49/50
- KODA (this session): 0/26 at 50/50, average 36.5/50

The gap is primarily in: D8 (progressive disclosure), D3 (conciseness), D7 (error handling), D2 (description quality), D10 (completeness). These are systemic — most KODA skills need `references/` dirs created, error handling sections added, and descriptions reformatted.

## Grinding Patterns (Reconfirmed)

1. **Full-rewrite strategy works.** For skills needing >10 changes, rewriting the SKILL.md from scratch (preserving knowledge, restructuring packaging) is faster and produces better results than incremental `patch` calls. Especially for imported community skills.

2. **Extract to references liberally.** A 516-line skill becomes 113 lines after extracting the command reference tables and step-by-step details to 3 reference files. Target ≤150 lines for the main SKILL.md.

3. **Error handling tables are the fastest D7 fix.** Every skill needs a `## Error Handling` section with a `| Failure | Diagnosis | Recovery |` table. 4-5 rows covers the common failure modes.

4. **"Why" for rigid rules (D6).** Every prescriptive statement ("never do X," "always do Y," "use Z first") needs a one-sentence rationale. Without it: D6 = 3-4. With it: D6 = 5.

5. **Verification checklists (D5).** Every skill with a 3+ step procedure needs a `- [ ]` checklist at the end. This single section often closes D10 simultaneously.

## Frontmatter Fixes Applied

The common frontmatter fix pattern for KODA skills:
```yaml
---
name: <name>                    # MUST match directory name
description: >                  # MUST follow [What] [When] [NOT for] formula
  ...
version: 1.1.0                  # bump on each change
author: Hermes Agent            # or original author if imported
license: MIT                    # always include
platforms: [linux, macos, windows]
includes:                       # REQUIRED if references/ exists
  - references/**
metadata:
  hermes:
    tags: [tag1, tag2]          # always include
    related_skills: [skill-a, skill-b]  # cross-reference

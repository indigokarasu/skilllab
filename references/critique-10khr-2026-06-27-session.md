# 10khr Session — June 27, 2026

## Target: ocas-imagine (44/50 → 50/50)

### Dimensions Fixed
- **D1 (4→5):** Added `metadata.hermes.category: creative`, moved tags under `metadata.hermes.tags`, added `metadata.hermes.config` with `POLLINATIONS_API_BASE`
- **D3 (4→5):** Removed "Ontology Mapping" section (obvious to agent), trimmed OKRs from 6 lines to 2 compact bullets
- **D5 (4→5):** Added checklists to both Flow 1 (5 items) and Flow 2 (7 items), added I/O examples with concrete input/output JSON
- **D7 (3→5):** Added full Error Handling table with 7 failure/handling pairs

### Already-Perfect Dimensions
D2, D4, D6, D8, D9, D10 all scored 5/5 without changes.

### Key Observations
- The heuristic scorer reported 46/50 (over-scored by 2 points). Manual assessment found 44/50.
- D7 was the biggest gap (3/5) — the skill had Gotchas but no structured error handling table.
- The fix pattern for D7 is now standardized: 7-row table covering API, tool, data, validation, output, IO, and input failures.
- `ocas-imagine` has 13 reference files — excellent progressive disclosure was already in place (D8=5).

### State After
- Skills improved total: 2 (util-cron-monitor on June 24, ocas-imagine on June 27)
- Next target: ocas-look (46/50, tied with ocas-styx and ocas-10xeng-audit)

# 10khr Session Log — 2026-05-29

## Session Summary

Assessed all 66 skills in the library. Identified and fixed Critical/D1 issues across all skills.

## Bulk D1 Pre-Pass Results (Before)

- **Missing includes:** 10 skills (had references/ directories but no includes: in frontmatter)
- **Invalid/missing license:** 21 skills
- **YAML parse errors:** 1 skill (util-buy — stray unmatched quote)

## Skills Fixed

### Auto-Generated Stub Rewrite (11 skills)
All were identical ~37-line stubs with no real content. Completely rewritten with domain-specific procedures, error handling, and pitfalls:

1. **browser-vision** — Browser screenshot + vision analysis for pages that resist text extraction
2. **vision-analyze** — Image analysis via vision_analyze tool with specific prompt patterns
3. **mcp-stealth-browser-spawn-browser** — Stealth browser instance management via MCP
4. **api-integration** — REST/GraphQL API integration with auth, rate limiting, retry patterns
5. **csv-parsing** — CSV parsing with encoding detection, delimiter inference, format conversion
6. **database-operations** — SQLite/PostgreSQL queries, schema management, import/export
7. **docker-management** — Container lifecycle, Docker Compose, debugging
8. **email-sending** — SMTP/API email sending with templates and delivery troubleshooting
9. **git-operations** — Branch workflows, rebasing, conflict resolution, undo patterns
10. **json-formatting** — Parse, format, validate, convert JSON with nested extraction
11. **unit-testing** — pytest fixtures, mocking, parameterized tests, coverage

### Frontmatter Fixes (14 skills)
Added missing `license: MIT` and/or `includes:` to:

1. **deployment** — Added license + includes
2. **hermes-agent-dev** — Added license + includes
3. **google-workspace-auth** — Added license + includes
5. **util-hermes-ops** — Added license
6. **util-amazon-history** — Added license + includes
7. **humanizer** — Added includes
8. **baoyu-article-illustrator** — Added includes
9. **iamwrite** — Added license + includes
10. **headhunter** — Added license + includes
11. **skill-publish** — Added license + includes
12. **skill-sanitize** — Added license + includes
13. **util-buy** — Fixed broken YAML frontmatter (stray unmatched quote character)

### Bulk D1 Results (After)
- **Missing includes:** 0 (excluding third-party `learn` skill)
- **Invalid/missing license:** 1 (third-party `learn` skill — external, not modified)
- **YAML parse errors:** 0

## Score Estimates (Before → After)

| Skill Category | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Dojo skeletons (×11) | ~22/50 (C) | ~33/50 (B) |
| Other non-ocas | ~25-33/50 | ~30-37/50 |
| OCAS skills | ~38-39/50 | unchanged |

## Key Patterns Applied
- All skills now have `license: MIT` (except third-party `learn`)
- All skills with `references/` dirs have `includes: [references/**]`
- Frontmatter uses `>` block scalar instead of single-quoted strings for multi-line descriptions
- All YAML parses cleanly (verified with yaml.safe_load on all 66 skills)

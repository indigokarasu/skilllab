# 10khr Session — 2026-05-30

## Scope
Full manual assessment of all 31 ocas-* skills. Heuristic over-scored by 6-10 points (lowest gap: 6 for ocas-mentor at heuristic 44 → real 38).

## Batch D1 Check Results
- 0 Critical issues across all 31 skills
- All have valid YAML, license: MIT, includes: fields
- No proprietary licenses, no phantom includes

## Responsibility Boundary Gaps (5 skills)
These skills are missing `## Responsibility Boundary` sections:
- ocas-fellow, ocas-forge, ocas-vibes, ocas-voyage, ocas-weave

Fix pattern (see `10khr-may-2026-batch.md` for template).

## Duplicate Lowercase Sections Pattern
Several older skills have duplicate `## When to use` / `## When not to use` (non-standard casing) after the standard-case sections. Fix: remove the lowercase duplicates.

## Grind: ocas-mentor (38→42)
Fixes applied:
1. Removed lowercase duplicate sections (-15 lines)
2. Moved inline config JSON to references/default-config.md (-19 lines, code ratio 8.4%→2.2%)
3. Expanded vague OKRs to specific 5-item table with targets/windows/measurements

## Structural Issues Found
- ocas-imagine: duplicate Support File Map (two identical maps)
- ocas-multipass: duplicate Support File Map header
- ocas-autobio: description uses second person ("your")
- ocas-genie: missing Gotchas section
- ocas-taste: evals/ in includes is non-standard

## Library Average
~38/50 real score. All skills Band A (30-39).

## Next Grinding Order
1. ocas-fellow — add Responsibility Boundary
2. ocas-forge — add Responsibility Boundary
3. ocas-vibes — add Responsibility Boundary
4. ocas-voyage — add Responsibility Boundary
5. ocas-weave — add Responsibility Boundary
6. ocas-genie — add Gotchas
